# ESP8266 / Sonic Pi OSC package

This package has been developed to allow a micro:bit to send OpenSound Control (OSC) directly to an instance of Sonic Pi.

It is built around a ESP8266 low cost serial Wi-Fi microchip built into [ELECFREAKS](https://www.elecfreaks.com/store/) iot:bit module. This was purchased in the UK from [Cool Components](https://coolcomponents.co.uk/products/iot-bit-for-bbc-micro-bit)
